        <h2>Rendering Opinion</h2>
        <p>Something sits right at the heart of our institutional design: institutional decay. The Constitution doesn’t make allowance for systems that optimize for themselves, because the framers assumed something that turned out not to be true over long time horizons:</p>
        <p><strong>That purpose, not incentive, would remain the governing force.</strong></p>
        <p>We have passed the moment when incentive quietly overtakes purpose, and the system keeps the appearance of serving people while internally reorganizing around its own survival, growth, and momentum.</p>
        <p>Let’s put clean language around it.</p>

        <h3>The Pattern — In Constitutional Terms</h3>

        <h3>1. The Constitution assumes service-oriented institutions</h3>
        <p>Every branch is designed around:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>accountability</li>
            <li>checks and balances</li>
            <li>public purpose</li>
            <li>limited scope</li>
            <li>human-scale decision-making</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is no clause that anticipates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>bureaucratic self-preservation</li>
            <li>incentive capture</li>
            <li>mission drift</li>
            <li>institutional expansion for its own sake</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The founders simply didn’t imagine systems becoming self-reinforcing organisms.</p>

        <h3>2. Modern institutions evolved beyond the scale the Constitution assumed</h3>
        <p>The Constitution was written for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a small population</li>
            <li>slow communication</li>
            <li>limited bureaucracy</li>
            <li>localized power</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But modern systems — whether government, corporate, or regulatory — operate at:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>massive scale</li>
            <li>high speed</li>
            <li>algorithmic complexity</li>
            <li>financialized incentives</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At that scale, systems naturally begin optimizing for themselves, because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>they have budgets</li>
            <li>they have metrics</li>
            <li>they have internal KPIs</li>
            <li>they have stakeholders</li>
            <li>they have political pressure</li>
            <li>they have survival instincts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>None of that existed in 1787.</p>

        <h3>3. When incentives replace purpose, the system still <em>looks</em> legitimate</h3>
        <p>This is the part that feels like “decay.”</p>
        <p>The outward form remains:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>courts still issue indictments</li>
            <li>agencies still publish rules</li>
            <li>corporations still claim to serve users</li>
            <li>pharma still claims to serve patients</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But internally, the logic has inverted:</p>
        <p><strong>The system’s needs come first.<br>
        The people’s needs become incidental.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Incidental — definition:</strong> Occurring or likely to occur as an unpredictable or minor consequence; accidental.</p>
        <p>The institution’s original mission, its purpose for existing, if it serves it at all, becomes accidental.</p>

        <h3>4. The Constitution doesn’t protect against incentive drift</h3>
        <p>It protects against:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>tyranny</li>
            <li>concentrated power</li>
            <li>government overreach</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But it does <strong>not</strong> protect against:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>bureaucratic expansion</li>
            <li>corporate capture</li>
            <li>institutional inertia</li>
            <li>self-reinforcing incentive loops</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Those are modern phenomena. Modernity has redefined tyranny.</p>
        <p>The founders built a system to prevent kings.<br>
        They didn’t anticipate <strong>self-optimizing institutions</strong>.</p>

        <h3>5. The “spirit” is the same across domains</h3>
        <p>The justice system, Google, big pharma — they don’t share a mission, but they share a <strong>failure mode</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>they drift from purpose</li>
            <li>they become self-referential</li>
            <li>they optimize for internal metrics</li>
            <li>they lose sight of the humans they were built to serve</li>
            <li>they redefine our common language when it does not serve them anymore</li>
            <li>then redefine it again as they shed accountability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Case in point: I am responsible for the outcome of my existence; what I create is an extension of me. I own it in my business plan.</p>
        <p>Responsibility can be intercepted by a process they designed and put in place. If the process causes a liability or injury, it was the process — therefore the process’s fault. They shed accountability like uncomfortable clothes, to be discarded.</p>
        <p>Different symptoms, same underlying mechanism, across the landscape.</p>
